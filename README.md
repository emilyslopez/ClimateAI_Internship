# ClimateAI -- Climate Data Science Intern

This folder has examples of the deliverables I made during my time as an intern, including:
* Jupyter notebook pdf that goes through the process of estimating uncertainty/ evaluating climate forecasting models and visualizing the results of this work
* My final technical presentation which I created with ArcGIS Story Map and python graphing and mapping packages. It summarizes my research with seasonal and subseasonal forecasts during the internship, inclduing the documentation I created for the project.
